## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Keeping track of scholarship applications is hard, and it's even more stressful when each application you apply to requires several recommendations, essays, and transcripts.  

- IDEAL: Have a place to store and process recommendations efficiently by sending letters of recommendations to your professors/collegues to fill out, and reuse them in several scholarships and college applications. 

- REALITY: Recommendations take time to be written and processed, and many students get discouraged from applying to scholarships for this reason. Recommendations usually have to be sent to the instutions privately and directly. However, it would be great to have a way to send friends a link to have them process the recommendation easily and fast for your benefit. 

- CONSEQUENCES: Not having a place dedicated to managing scholarships and recommendations discourages a lot of students from applying and from receiving funding opportunities. 


## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

A web app that keeps your recommendations secured, accessible, and within reach for you to use in scholarships, college applications and more. 



## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

- Enable option to have users send emails or messages through the application to get recommendations from others

- Add Student Dashboard: track and manage documents, notes

- Profile page updates: allow users to update their profile, and or add portfolio
